# AStar-Algorithm
Astar Algorithm implemented to traverse a graph with weighted nodes.

The main point of this Project was to implement an Astar algorithm, which is similar to a Dijskras Algorith with an added heuristic. This saved an immense amount of time as well as space.
You will notice that on even most modern computers the dijkras will fail to find the path due to a memory overload, whereas the Astar algorithm smartly traverses the graph finding the path with little issue.
